# Sampling Assignment

## Sampling Techniques Implemented

Simple Random Sampling: Randomly selects a subset of the data.

Systematic Sampling: Selects samples at regular intervals.

Stratified Sampling: Ensures proportional representation of each class in the sample.

Cluster Sampling: Divides the data into clusters and randomly selects clusters.

Reservoir Sampling: Ensures randomness for large or unknown datasets by maintaining a fixed-size sample.

## Machine Learning Models Evaluated

The following machine learning models were used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Best Sampling Technique

Systematic Sampling consistently achieved the highest accuracy (1.0000) across all models, making it the best-performing sampling technique for this dataset and set of models.
